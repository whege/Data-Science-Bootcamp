# Data Science Bootcamp
Curriculum, presentations, notes, and exercises for a Data Science Bootcamp streamed on Twitch. 

## Background
I created this bootcamp in response to several factors:
1. I noticed in my time on Twitch in Software/Dev streams that there was interest in the Data Science field from devs who were a) just starting out their coding career or b) looking to transition into Data Science.
2. I also recognized that there wasn't a _ton_ of Data Science content on Twitch, and what content I did find seemed more geared towards people familiar with the industry.
3. I've seen a lot of confusion about Data Science - what the field is, what the job is, what different types of jobs exist, and what "a day in the life" of a someone in Data Science looks like.

## My Goal
My goal with this bootcamp is not neccesarily, explicitly, or exclusively to teach people how to code, how to build/train models, etc. There are plenty of established and useful resources available online for people to learn. Rather, the goal is to provide resource for people looking to start their career in Data Science, in part:
1. What _is_ Data Science?
2. What jobs are available in Data Science?
3. What can I expect to do day-to-day in a Data Science career?
4. What skills do I need to have and what technologies should I be familiar with for a career in Data Science?
5. How does one go about learning the necessary topics and building a resume / portfolio for Data Science jobs?

As the course progresses, the topics will shift away from these abstract ideas into more practical ones, such as:
1. Reviewing popular algorithms and how they function
2. Best practices when encountering a new dataset
3. Developing communication skills to be able to pass technical information along to non-technical parties.

## Using the bootcamp
While the lessons are streamed on Twitch, providing a place for interaction, feedback, and Q&A, the bootcamp can certainly be completed on its own by following through the presentations and completing the exercises as necessary. While the bootcamp is intended to be completed in order, those who are familiar with certain topics are free to jump through the course to complete sections as they desire. 

## Contributing
While this is a personal project, I like to see it as a community effort. I'm always open to feedback on the contents of the bootcamp. If something about a lesson seems incorrect or could use some additional details, or you feel like a new section or lession could be added, feel free to submit a Pull Request. The same things goes for exercises. If you feel an additional exercise could be beneficial, or some of the code in an exercise is wrong, new submissions / corrections are happily accepted and will be reviewed and merged if appropriate.
